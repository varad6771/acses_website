# ACSES
This website was created for ACSES (departmental committee), as part of an event in my second year of college. As such, it is an extremely rough piece of work done in a matter of 5 hours. 
This also contains a chatbot which provided basic information about the event, courtsy of my friend. Website is mostly plain html,css and bot is rvescript, js and node.
